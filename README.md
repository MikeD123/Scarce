# Scarce
Scarce is an application built on Ethereum/Token which aims to be a second market for people missing out on ICO's. Think Stubhub meets Smart Contracts meets Tokens.

## Problem 
After missing out on the Brave browser token sale, I spent hours trying to line up and organize a purchase of some BAT tokens at a premium to what they were listed for. This was difficult, slow, and the discovery process was painful.

## Solution 
- Allowing people to register their interest to both sell their tokens, and acquire tokens they missed out on.
- By creating a smart contract for someone who wishes to sell their tokens, and storing them.
- Releasing them to wallets that deposit Ether into that contract. 
- It releases proportionately at a premium of 20% above the cost price at ICO.

## Example
- Scarce utilizes smart contracts to allow trustless trade of tokens. We find token holders who wish to rest their tokens in a smart contract awaiting a purchaser to pay a premium. 
- Example: 1 ETH = 1000 COIN. I deposit 1 ETH into this smart contract. It carries a premium of 20% of the purchase price. So my 1 ETH gets me 800 COIN. As I make the deposit to the specified address, it is released automatically to my address.

## Why
As ICO's become more prevelant, and protocol tokens become more required for usage. This tool will remove the following:
- less intimidating for new people to get started 
- Without the need for creating multiple exchange accounts
- Multiple verifications
- Difficulty in understanding how to trade with graphs, market depth and other jargon

## Hackathon related information
- I missed out on actually finalizing the smart contract stuff because I wasted too much time finding the appropriate emoji's to be used throughout the bot dialogue. ðŸ˜‚
- The links to Etherscan are just dummy place holders that I felt were relevant to understand the user experience ðŸ‘Œ

There's a ton of holes here but I only got started on this like 20 hours before entry (You can confirm that with Mark who was assisting me in the slack channel. Hahaha...)

I think this has a lot of cool potential, and would love any feedback! 
Thanks so much.
